i think it is now time i talk about infrastructure as code (some interviewers ask these days; it isn't necessarily an irrelevant question in case you come across iac).

anyways, infrastructure as code is just an idea in the cloud stuff and infosec. it is just about defining and managing IT infrastructure through code rather than relying on manual processes. so, iac is literally a significant shift in how we handle and operate infrastructure resources, to allow us enjoy automation and scalability.
